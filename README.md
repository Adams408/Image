# Image
1. Write an HTML document that contains an image with two hotspots, one in the shape of a square, the other a triangle, as shown in the figure at right.  Choose your own image and make the hotspots large enough so that they are easily selected. One hotspot loads a page with a bulleted list of the months of the year as shown at right. The other hotspot loads a page with a list of the seasons labeled in order with uppercase letters as shown below. The pages that are loaded should be complete HTML documents, with an html element containing a head element (itself containing a title) and a body element (with the appropriate elements as its content).
